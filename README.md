## 游댫 How to use it
I recommend using BizHawk, it's easy to use & pretty robust _(I also only tested it in Bizhawk)_.  
After loading the rom, just drag the lua file into BizHawk window or in the menu "Tools > LUA console" and open the file.

## 游닍 The Features

- Hibox Viewer!
- Combo counter in real time (number of hits in your last combo)
- Damage output (last combo damage)
- Stun / foe's stamina - timer until stun reset
- Training Dummy's state (WIP)

> **Disclaimer**: When you start the training mode, damage is at -1, it will go to zero once you hit the training dummy.



## 游대 To DO & Ideas
**Color code:**  
游댮 Hard  |  游리 Intermediate  |  游릭 Easy  |  游댯 Unsure


**Important**
1. 游리 Show when the opponent can tech (true vs fake combo)
1. 游댮 Ground / wall / throw tech option for the dummy (I kinda have the code for it, but the dummy doesn't accept the inputs >.>)
1. 游리 show startup/recovery like Skullgirls would be pretty cool too (frame data would be awesome in itself)
1. 游댮 Somehow make the hitboxes white when invincible (eg. on Torami's j22 or when you hit the juggle system limit & drop out).

**Good Quality of life**
1. 游릭 Input history (with frame counter? Would make it easier to test the juggle systems limits)
1. 游릭 Having macro to activate X part of the script (eg. activate enemy wall/ground teching)
1. 游댯 Make the text scale with window (imo avoid textPixel)

**Not a Priority**
1. 游릭 Make the game heal to max health, instead of "max health1.1"
1. 游릭 Only show / start script once in Deku battle (training mode)
